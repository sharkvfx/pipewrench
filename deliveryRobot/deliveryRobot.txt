Need to define the delivery directory structure for each user:

/<user>/to_mvrcks/<project>/<shot>/<version>/

OR

should it match shotgun structure (which should make more sense)

/<user>/to_mvrcks/<project>/<episode>/<sequence>/<shot>/<step>/publish/renders/<version>/...files...
eg.
/<user>/to_mvrcks/msw/001/001-abc/001-abc-030/Comp/publish/renders/001-abc-030_Comp_v001/001-abc-030_Comp_v001.0001.dpx
                                                                                         001-abc-030_Comp_v001.0002.dpx
                                                                                         ..
                                                                                         001-abc-030_Comp_v001.0050.dpx
                                                                                         001-abc-030_Comp_v001.0051.dpx
                                                                                    

Watch <user>/to_mvrcks/msw   for a new directory (episode)
    if new dir is found then watch in that dir for a new directory (sequence)
        if new dir is found then watch in that dir for a new directory (shot)
            if new dir is found then watch in ./Comp/publish/renders/ for a new directory (version)
                if new iversion dir is found then 
                    get shot no and frames epected from Shotgun
                    watch in ./Comp/publish/renders/<version>  for  new files (version)
                    get file names and file count
                    once file count == shotgun frames publish shot to shotgun
                    exit
                exit
            exit
        exit
    exit
